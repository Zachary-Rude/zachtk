## **About**
[zach.tk](https://zach.tk) is a free and open-source URL shortener by Zach, Inc., designed as an alternative to other URL shorteners, such as [Bitly](https://bitly.com) and [TinyURL](https://tinyurl.com).

## **Advantages**
* You do **not** need an account to use it.
* Its UI is very simple and straightforward.
* It uses 301 redirects, which are permanent redirects; as a result, zach.tk shortlinks never expire.

## **Usage**
1. Go to [zach.tk](https://zach.tk) in your web browser.
2. In the provided text box, enter the URL you wish to shorten (you can either copy and paste your URL into the text box or manually type it).
3. Press `Enter ↵` or `Return ↵` on your keyboard, or click the blue "Shorten" button, which is located directly to the right of the URL text box.
4. Once the zach.tk shortlink has been generated, you can then open the shortlink *at any time* (they never expire, as zach.tk uses 301 redirects, as mentioned above) in your browser, and as you might expect, the shortlink will automatically redirect the URL that you typed in the text box earlier.
